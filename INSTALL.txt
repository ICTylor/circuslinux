Version 1.0.3

April 28, 2001


GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------

  CONTROLS
  --------
    The game is controlled using a mouse.  It can be played with either
    a mouse, a joystick, a real Atari paddle, or the keyboard.

    (Note: Joystick code requires version 1.1.x of Simple DirectMedia Layer
    or higher.  The Windows release uses 1.0.8, which does not include
    joystick support.  See FAQ.txt.)


REQUIREMENTS TO COMPILE
-----------------------
  SDL
  ---
    "Circus Linux!" was programed using the "Simple Direct Media" layer
    libraries by Sam Lantinga.  This means that the game can
    theoretically run under any environment that the SDL libraries support.

    (As of this program's release, this includes: Linux X11/DGA,
    Win32 WinDIB/DirectX, BeOS BWindow, and Solaris X11, as well
    as unofficually supported: Linux SVGAlib, IRIX 6.x X11,
    FreeBSD 3.x X11, and MacOS.)

    The Simple DirectMedia Layer is required to compile this game.

    You can download the SDL libraries from:
      http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/

  SDL_image
  ---------
    SDL_image is also required.  (It is used to load the PNG format images
    that come with Circus Linux!)

    You can download SDL_image from:
      http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/projects/SDL_image/

  SDL_mixer
  ---------
    Sound and music are available, but are not required (see below).
    You will need the "SDL_mixer" library compiled and installed if
    you want sound.

    You can download SDL_mixer from:
      http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/projects/SDL_mixer/


INSTALLING UNDER LINUX/UNIX
---------------------------
  First, run the configuration script, "./configure":

    ./configure


  To compile circuslinux with joystick support (required for playing the game
  with either a PC joystick, or an Atari paddle connected to the PC's
  joystick port), make sure you have a version of SDL that supports joystick
  (1.1.2 and above).  When you run "./configure," do it like this:

    ./configure --enable-joystick


  Then compile the game:

    make


  Then (as super-user, if you're installing the game in the default
  location of "/usr/") install the game:

    make install

  This should  put circuslinux and the data files in the right place.
  The README.txt and friends go into /usr/doc/circuslinux-<version>/


  In case you want to remove(!) circuslinux do a

    make uninstall

  from the source directory.
  This should remove all circuslinux files safely.


CROSS-COMPILING FOR WINDOWS UNDER LINUX
---------------------------------------
  Get an EGCS-based compiler for Win32, like the one available here:

    http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/Xmingw32/

  Follow the instructions in SDL's "README.Win32" file regarding compiling
  and installing the Windows32 cross-compiled version of SDL.

  Also, cross-compile SDL_mixer, SDL_image and the png libraries,
  following similar instructions to above.  (Note: Set the "--prefix"
  value when running "./configure" for these two libraries.)

  Finally, in the circuslinux directory, run:

    make -f Makefile-win32

  This will build the ".exe" and copy the SDL ".dll" files into the
  directory.

    The "png" and "z" libraries are available at:

      http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngcode.html


ICON FILE
---------
  A 32x32, XPM-format icon file (using the standard 23-color "cmap.xpm"
  color palette) is available if you wish to use an icon for this game.

  The file is "circuslinux-icon.xpm", and installed in Circus Linux!'s
  "data/images/" directory.


The End!
