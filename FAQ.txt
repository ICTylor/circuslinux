GENERAL PROBLEMS:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
I want the mouse pointer to stay within the window.

  SOLUTION:
  During the game, press the [G] key to turn mouse-grabbing on.
  (You can press it again to turn it off.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
My mouse is gone!

  CAUSE:
  "Mouse-grabbing" is on.  The mouse pointer (which, by the way, is
  invisible) cannot be removed from the window.

  SOLUTION:
  Press the [G] key to turn mouse-grabbing back off.
  (You can press it again to turn it back on, if you like).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
When using a joystick, the teeter-totter jumps between the left, middle and
right positions, instead of moving smoothly.

  CAUSE:
  This is because your joystick is digital.  It only has a left, right and
  middle position.

    SOLUTION:
    Use the "--digital" option when you start the program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
When using real Atari paddles, the teeter-totter moves the opposite direction
and doesn't go all the way to the edges.

  CAUSE:
  Atari 2600 paddles are calibrated differently.

    SOLUTION:
    Use the "--paddle" option when you start th eprogram.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
The game is very slow on my computer.

  CAUSE:
  Your computer is probably not very fast, or you have a slow video card.

    SOLUTION:
    Use the "--low" option when you start the program.

    SOLUTION:
    Try using a different color depth.  16bpp is better (faster) than 24bpp,
    for example.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
There's no sound or music.

  CAUSE:
  Your computer doesn't have a sound card, or it's misconfigured.

    SOLUTION:
    Get a sound card and make sure it's configured.

  CAUSE:
  Another program is using your sound device.

    SOLUTION:
    Quit that program.

  CAUSE:
  You ran the program with the "--disable-sound" or "--nosound" or "-q" option.

    SOLUTION:
    Quit Circus Linux! and start it again without any sound-disabling option.

  CAUSE:
  The volume settings are set to "off".

    SOLUTION:
    Click the "SFX" and "MUSIC" options on Circus Linux!'s title screen until
    the volume of the sound effects and music are at suitable volumes.

  CAUSE:
  The game is paused.

    SOLUTION:
    Press the [SPACE] key.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
The clowns bounce back down when they hit balloons.

  CAUSE:
  The "Bouncy Balloons" game option is set.

    SOLUTION:
    Click the "Bouncy Balloons" option on the title screen so that the
    option is no longer set.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


WINDOWS PROBLEMS:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
My joystick doesn't work!

  CAUSE:
  The current version of Circus Linux! uses a stable version of the
  Simple DirectMedia Layer library.  That version does not include
  joystick support.

    SOLUTION:
    Wait for a newer release of Circus Linux!, after SDL jumps to 1.2.x.
    (See: http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/ )


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


LINUX PROBLEMS:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
My joystick doesn't work!

  CAUSE:
  Is your joystick plugged-in and configured to work right?

    SOLUTION:
    Make sure your joystick is plugged in and configured (see your Linux
    distribution's manual).

  CAUSE:
  Circus Linux! wasn't compiled to play with a joystick.

    SOLUTION:
    Run "make distclean" and then make sure you use the
    "--enable-joystick" option when you run "./configure" (see INSTALL.txt)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
When compiling, there's an error about SDL_JOYAXISMOTION not being defined.

  CAUSE:
  The version of SDL you have does not support joysticks.

    SOLUTION:
    Run "make distclean" and then make sure you _don't_ use the
    "--enable-joystick" option when you run "./configure" (see INSTALL.txt)

    SOLUTION:
    Get SDL version 1.1.2 or higher, which supports joystick.
