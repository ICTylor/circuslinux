1.0.3 - April 28, 2001
----------------------
  * Added support for real Atari 2600 paddles (connected to the PC joystick
    port).  Atari paddles are calibrated slightly different, and are also
    reversed.  Thanks to Mark Kim for building the paddle adapter for me!

1.0.2 - August 5, 2000
----------------------
  * You can now press the [G] key to toggle mouse-grabbing (that is,
    whether the mouse pointer is trapped within the window or not).
    Clement Bourdarias <cbour@cybercable.tm.fr>

  * Audio is now opened at 44.1Khz (so it sounds better, and works better
    under MacOS).
    Darrell Walisser <dwaliss1@purdue.edu>

  * MacOS version of 1.0.1 released (with above fix).
    Darrell Walisser <dwaliss1@purdue.edu>

1.0.1 - June 4, 2000
--------------------
  * Makefile.am tweaks: Documents now installed into "$(prefix)/share/doc/",
    instead of "/usr/doc/";  Data file permissions set to 755. (Still no good!)
    Martin Willemoes Hansen <mwh@stampede.org>

1.0.0 - May 29, 2000
--------------------
  * Makefile.am and data/Makefile.am tweaks.
    Vikram Subramanian <upender@vsnl.com>

  * Game prefers 16-bit depth, but prefers native depth over
    emulated 16-bit!
    Mattias Engdegard <f91-men@nada.kth.se>

  * Data file permissions set nicely for .tar.gz releases.

  * Version number upgraded to '1.0.0' since everything seems pretty
    much done!

  * Added copying (GPL) information.  Run "circuslinux --copying"

  * Usage display reorganized.  (Run "circuslinux --usage")


0.0.8 - May 25, 2000
--------------------
  * Added keyboard control.  (LEFT/RIGHT and RETURN/ALT/SHIFT)

  * Made mouse pointer invisible.

  * Divided FAQ into "General Problems," and "Linux Problems."

  * Divided Mouse, Joystick and Keyboard control descriptions in README.txt.

  * Now calls "SDL_SetColorKey()" before "SDL_DisplayFormat()," so sprites
    shouldn't appear broken at 8-bit color depth.

  * Tweaked analog joystick code

  * Initial Windows 32-bit release.  Makefile-win32 created with help from
    Brian Hayward <hayward@slothmud.org>


0.0.7 - May 23, 2000
--------------------
  * Title music has finally been made!  (It's called "Finally" :) )


0.0.6 - May 22, 2000
--------------------
  * Updated configure.in to contain correct version number.

  * Updated INSTALL.txt.


0.0.5 - May 21, 2000
--------------------
  * Now uses SDL's accellerated RLE blitting for colorkeyed images.

  * Added more information to the game description in README.txt.

  * Used "pngcrush" to get better compression in the graphics files.

  * A little piece of "W" was visible next to "X"'s in the text font.  Fixed.

  * Music now gets paused, not stoped and restarted from the beginning, when
    you pause the game.

  * Added "./configure" script.
    Vikram Subramanian <upender@vsnl.com>


0.0.4 - April 11, 2000
----------------------
  Bugs Fixed
  ----------
    * --fullscreen switch was broken (used "if" instead of "else if"). Fixed.
      Torbjorn Andersson <torbjorn@dev.eurotime.se>

    * Joystick support is now a compile-time option (since the stable version
      of SDL doesn't have joystick code yet... oops!)  Compile with "JOY=NO"
      to disable joystick support.
      Christian T. Steigies <cts@debian.org>

    * Joystick setup code checked Axes a 2nd time instead of buttons.  Fixed.


0.0.3 - April 9, 2000
----------------------
  New Features Added
  ------------------
    * Clowns now launch a little higher (more realistically) from the
      teeter-totter.

    * Added note to use "--usage" for command-line options in "--help" display.

    * Added more variations of command line options:
      "--nosound" and "-q" are the same as "--disable-sound",
      "-l" is the same as "--low", and
      "-f" is the same as "--fullscreen".

    * Added game over screen music.
      Jarkko Rotsten <roz@sci.fi>

    * Changed "sdlconfig --libs" to "sdlconfig --static-libs" in Makefile,
      so that it will build better under m68k Linux.
      Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>

    * Tweaked arguments used in Mix_OpenAudio() call to make audio sound
      better on slower machines.

    * BMP files converted to PNG files to save space.  SDL_Image library
      now required.

    * Joystick code added (analog and digital supported).

    * Added an FAQ document.


0.0.2 - March 12, 2000
----------------------
  Planned Features Implemented
  ----------------------------
    * High scores screen now has music.

    * Bear circus act added.

  New Features Added
  ------------------
    * [TAB], [SPACE] or [P] now pauses/unpauses during the game.

      Christian T. Steigies <cts@debian.org>

    * Balloons flash colors when high score is acheived.

    * Command-line options described in usage display.

    * "--low" option added.  Less flashy display will be used so there's
      a better chance it can run on low-end hardware.

    * If you don't fill out your initials when you get a high score, it
      will try to figure it out based on your real name or username (Linux).

    * Text bitmap looks nicer.
